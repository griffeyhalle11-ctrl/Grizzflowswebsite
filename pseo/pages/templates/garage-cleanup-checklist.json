This checklist walks you through every step of a complete garage transformation—from initial planning to final organization. Print it out, work through it, and finally reclaim your space.",

        "body": "**□ Set a realistic timeline**: Full garage cleanouts take 1-3 days for DIY. Block the time on your calendar.\n\n**□ Gather supplies**: You'll need trash bags, boxes, markers, cleaning supplies, and work gloves.\n\n**□ Arrange disposal**: Schedule a dump run, rent a dumpster, or book a junk removal service.\n\n**□ Check the weather**: You'll need driveway space for sorting. Pick a dry day.\n\n**□ Recruit help**: This is a 2+ person job. Bribe friends with pizza if needed.\n\n**□ Set your 'done' criteria**: What does success look like? Car fits inside? All items accessible? Define it."

        "heading": "Phase 1: The Complete Cleanout",
        "body": "**□ Remove everything from the garage**: Every box, tool, and mystery item comes out. No exceptions.\n\n**□ Create sorting zones in your driveway**:\n   - KEEP (going back in)\n   - DONATE (good condition)\n   - SELL (worth the effort)\n   - TRASH (broken, worn, useless)\n\n**□ Go through every item**: Touch each thing and make a decision. No 'maybe' pile allowed.\n\n**□ Apply the 2-year rule**: Haven't used it in 2 years? It goes unless it's genuinely sentimental.\n\n**□ Handle the emotional items**: Old kids' stuff, inherited items—set these aside for a focused decision session.\n\n**□ Document valuable items**: Take photos of anything you're selling or donating for records."

Hose down if possible.\n\n**□ Clean the garage door (inside and out)**: Don't forget the tracks.\n\n**□ Wipe down light fixtures**: Better lighting makes the whole space feel better.\n\n**□ Check for pests**: Look for droppings, nests, or damage. Address before putting items back.\n\n**□ Inspect walls for damage**: Note any repairs needed (holes, water damage).\n\n**□ Let it dry completely**: Before putting anything back, ensure the floor is fully dry."

Label anyway.\n\n**□ Label everything**: Use a label maker or painter's tape and marker.\n\n**□ Create a 'staging' area**: Spot for donations, returns, items leaving the house.\n\n**□ Leave floor space**: Keep the center clear for car parking and access."

      {
        "question": "How long should a garage cleanup take?",
        "answer": "For DIY, expect 4-6 hours for a lightly cluttered 1-car garage, up to 2-3 days for a packed 2-3 car garage. Professionals typically complete most jobs in 4-8 hours because they have systems and help."
      },
      {
        "question": "What's the best way to organize a garage?",
        "answer": "Zone-based organization works best. Create distinct areas for tools, sports equipment, seasonal items, and storage. Keep frequently used items at arm's reach, seasonal stuff on high shelves, and rarely touched items in less accessible spots."
      },
      {
        "question": "Should I rent a dumpster for garage cleanup?",
        "answer": "Dumpster rental makes sense for major cleanouts with lots of trash. Typical cost is $300-500 for a 10-yard dumpster. If you have less than a pickup truck's worth of junk, a dump run might be more economical. Professional services like ours include junk removal in the flat rate."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I decide what to keep vs. throw away?",
        "answer": "Use the 2-year rule: if you haven't used it in 2 years and it's not genuinely sentimental or legally required, let it go. Ask yourself: if you needed this item tomorrow, would you even remember you had it? If not, it's clutter."
