    "introduction": "Manhattan Beach homes command premium prices—which makes your garage square footage some of the most expensive storage space in LA County. If you're using a $2M+ property to store boxes you haven't opened in years, it's time for a reset. GrizzFlow's Garage helps Manhattan Beach homeowners reclaim their garages with flat-rate cleanup starting at $325.",

        "heading": "The Manhattan Beach Garage Problem",
        "body": "We've cleaned garages across Manhattan Beach and we see the same pattern: successful professionals who are too busy to deal with the accumulation. The golf clubs you'll 'get back into someday.' The kids' old sports equipment. The home improvement projects that never happened.\n\nThe result? Expensive cars parked in the driveway, exposed to salt air and sun damage. Meanwhile, the garage becomes an expensive storage unit you're already paying the mortgage on."

      {
        "question": "How long does a Manhattan Beach garage cleanup take?",
        "answer": "Most jobs complete in 4-8 hours depending on size and clutter level. A light 1-car cleanup might be done in 3 hours; a packed 3-car could take a full day. We give you a time estimate with your quote."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can you work around my cars in the garage?",
        "answer": "We need the garage empty of vehicles to do a proper cleanup. Most Manhattan Beach clients move cars to the driveway or street for the day. We'll let you know when it's safe to pull back in."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do you offer ongoing maintenance service?",
        "answer": "Our focus is the initial transformation. However, many clients book us annually for a 'reset' to prevent re-accumulation. We're happy to schedule recurring cleanups."
      },
      {
        "question": "What if I'm not sure what to keep or toss?",
        "answer": "No problem. We work with you on decision-making. Our approach: if you haven't used it in 2+ years and it has no sentimental value, it's probably clutter. But ultimately, you decide everything."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are you insured?",
        "answer": "Yes. We carry liability insurance. Your property and our team are protected throughout the job."
