    "introduction": "Your garage is one of the first—and last—things buyers see during a showing. A cluttered garage signals deferred maintenance and reduces perceived home value. A clean, organized garage says 'this home is well-maintained' and can genuinely impact your sale price. GrizzFlow's Garage helps South Bay home sellers transform their garages before listing—typically in a single day for $325-$625.",

        "heading": "Why Your Garage Matters When Selling",
        "body": "Real estate studies consistently show that buyers form impressions within seconds. Your garage is often:\n\n• **The last thing buyers see** before leaving (and making their decision)\n• **A proxy for how you've maintained the rest** of the home\n• **Usable square footage** that buyers mentally calculate\n\nA packed, dusty garage tells buyers you've been putting off maintenance. A clean garage signals pride of ownership and attention to detail—qualities that translate to higher offers."

        "heading": "The Home Seller's Garage Dilemma",
        "body": "You're already overwhelmed. You're decluttering closets, fixing small repairs, staging rooms, coordinating with your agent. The garage keeps sliding down the priority list.\n\nMeanwhile, you're facing a deadline: your listing date. You don't have time for multiple dump runs, Craigslist coordination, and organizing what's left.\n\nThat's where we come in. One call, one day, one flat rate—and your garage is showing-ready."

      {
        "heading": "What We Do for Home Sellers",
        "body": "**Complete Cleanout**: We remove everything, letting you keep only what moves with you.\n\n**Deep Cleaning**: Floors swept and mopped, cobwebs cleared, walls wiped. The garage should smell clean when buyers walk in.\n\n**Minimal Staging**: We can arrange remaining items (tools, lawn equipment) in a way that shows the space's potential, not its clutter.\n\n**Junk Removal**: Donation coordination and dump runs included. No separate fees.\n\n**Fast Turnaround**: We understand listing timelines. Same-week service, sometimes next-day."
      },
      {
        "heading": "The ROI of a Clean Garage",
        "body": "Consider the math:\n\n• **Service cost**: $325-$625\n• **Your time saved**: 15-30 hours of sorting, hauling, cleaning\n• **Potential impact on sale price**: $1,000-$10,000+\n\nA clean garage doesn't just help you sell—it helps you sell faster and for more money. Buyers who see a well-maintained garage are less likely to nickel-and-dime you on inspections and repairs."

No hourly charges, no surprise fees."

      {
        "question": "How soon before listing should I clean the garage?",
        "answer": "Ideally 1-2 weeks before photos are taken. This gives you time to see the space fresh and make any final adjustments. We can accommodate tighter timelines if needed—sometimes we do same-day cleanups before photographer visits."

      {
        "question": "What if I need to store items until I move?",
        "answer": "We can help you identify what needs to go to storage and organize those items for easy transport. We don't provide storage ourselves, but we can prepare items for a storage unit or POD."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can you coordinate with my real estate agent?",
        "answer": "Absolutely. We're happy to work around showing schedules and coordinate directly with your agent if that's easier. Just let us know their contact info."
      },
      {
        "question": "What if I'm selling the items, not trashing them?",
        "answer": "We can set aside sale items and help you organize them. If you're doing an estate sale or garage sale, we can prep the space and remaining items after those sales happen."

        "answer": "Yes. We cover Hermosa Beach, Manhattan Beach, Redondo Beach, Torrance, El Segundo, Palos Verdes, and surrounding areas. If you're in the South Bay, we can help."
