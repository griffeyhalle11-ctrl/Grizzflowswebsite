## Corrections
| Date | Source | What Went Wrong | What To Do Instead |
|------|--------|----------------|-------------------|
| 2026-02-06 | user | Built v4 homepage with different design | Griff prefers his own v3 design - don't redesign, enhance what exists |
| 2026-02-06 | user | Suggested too many emojis initially | NO emojis anywhere - Griff hates AI slop |
| 2026-02-06 | self | Claude Code agents hung with no output | Use sessions_spawn for parallel work, not raw claude -p exec |
| 2026-02-06 | self | Playwright needed browser install | Don't assume puppeteer/playwright work - check first |

## User Preferences
- Dark camo theme with olive/tan/brown colors
- NO emojis - considers them AI slop
- Less text, more visuals
- Tight punchy copy
- Grizzly bear branding (not emoji)
- Prefers execution over discussion
- Flat-rate pricing model ($325/$475/$625/$800+)

## Patterns That Work
- sessions_spawn for parallel background tasks - completes reliably
- pSEO location pages with unique neighborhood content per city
- Schema markup with LocalBusiness + FAQPage for rich snippets
- GSAP for scroll animations
- Dark theme with camo pattern backgrounds

## Patterns That Don't Work
- claude -p exec for long tasks - hangs/stalls
- Puppeteer/Playwright without pre-installed browsers
- Browser automation on Windows via OpenClaw browser tool - unreliable
- Redesigning user's work instead of enhancing it
