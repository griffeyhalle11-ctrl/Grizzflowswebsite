            <h1>Garage Cleanup for Moving In or Out</h1>
            <p class="intro">Moving is controlled chaos. Boxes everywhere, utilities to transfer, addresses to change, furniture placement to figure out—and somewhere in the middle of all that, there's a garage that needs dealing with. Whether you're moving out and facing years of accumulated stuff you can't take with you, or moving into a new place and inheriting someone else's abandoned mess, GrizzFlow's Garage gets it handled fast. One day, flat rate, timed to your move date. From $350. We respond within 5 minutes because we know your timeline doesn't flex.</p>
            
            <section>
                <h2>Moving Out: Don't Pay Movers to Haul Your Junk</h2>
                <p>Here's a pattern we see constantly: someone's been in their home 5, 10, 20 years. The garage became the default storage zone—broken furniture that might get fixed someday, boxes from three moves ago that haven't been opened since, exercise equipment collecting dust and spider webs, kids' outgrown toys, holiday decorations for holidays you don't even celebrate anymore.</p>
                <p>Now moving day is approaching, and you're facing an ugly choice:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Pay your movers by the hour to carefully wrap and haul junk</strong> across the country to your new garage, where it'll just sit and clutter up the fresh start you're paying for</li>
                    <li><strong>Spend your last precious weeks in the house</strong> dealing with a garage cleanout project instead of saying goodbyes, handling logistics, and actually preparing for the move</li>
                    <li><strong>Leave it for the buyers and hope for the best</strong>, risking contract violations, escrow delays, having to fly back to deal with it, or eating the cost of a cleaning deduction from your deposit</li>
                </ul>
                <p>None of those options make sense. The smart move is to handle the garage before the moving trucks arrive—so your movers only touch things you actually want at the new place, and you start fresh without dragging a decade of deferred decisions with you.</p>
                <p>We've helped hundreds of families relocating out of South Bay. We come in the week before your move—or earlier if your schedule allows—remove everything you're not taking, deep clean the space to broom-clean condition, and leave it ready for the new owners' walkthrough or your landlord's final inspection. One thing checked off a very long list, handled by someone who knows exactly what they're doing.</p>
            </section>
            
            <section>
                <h2>Moving In: Start Fresh, Not Frustrated</h2>
                <p>Bought or rented a place with a garage full of the previous owner's abandoned stuff? It happens far more often than you'd think. Sometimes it's part of an estate sale where the family couldn't deal with everything. Sometimes the sellers got overwhelmed by their own move and left things behind. Sometimes your new landlord says "just throw it out" without telling you how or offering to cover the cost.</p>
                <p>Either way, you've got a garage you can't use—and your own boxes and furniture are arriving on a truck any day now. You need that space functional immediately, not after you spend a weekend sorting through a stranger's forgotten belongings.</p>
                <p>We specialize in exactly this situation. We'll clear out whatever was left behind—old furniture, mystery boxes, rusted tools, broken appliances, bags of who-knows-what, half-empty paint cans, deflated pool toys from a pool you don't have—and have your garage ready to receive your actual belongings. No sorting through someone else's stuff. No wondering if that suspicious box is worth opening. No hauling loads to the dump when you should be unpacking your kitchen. We handle all of it in a single day.</p>
                <p>The best timing: get us in before your movers arrive. That way, your first day in the new house isn't spent working around someone else's mess—it's spent unloading your stuff into a clean, functional space that's actually yours.</p>
            </section>
            
            <section>
                <h2>Why Timing Is Everything</h2>
                <p>Moving timelines are unforgiving. You've got overlapping leases, closing dates, utility transfers, and about fifty other things that all need to happen in a very specific order. Adding "figure out the garage" to that list at the last minute creates stress you don't need.</p>
                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <p><strong>The ideal timeline:</strong><br>
                    • Contact us 1-2 weeks before your move date<br>
                    • We schedule within 2-3 days of your call<br>
                    • Garage is cleared before movers arrive or keys transfer<br>
                    • You focus on the hundred other moving tasks without this hanging over you</p>
                </div>
                <p>That said, we understand that moving is unpredictable. Plans change. Closings get moved up. You suddenly realize the garage is a problem three days before the truck shows up. If you're calling us with 48 hours notice because things got away from you, we'll do everything possible to fit you in. We've done same-day emergency cleanouts for people in exactly that bind. Just tell us what you're working with and we'll find a solution.</p>
            </section>
            
            <section>
                <h2>What's Included in Every Move Cleanup</h2>
                <p><strong>Complete Cleanout:</strong> Everything goes—we remove all items you're not taking with you. No need to sort through it first unless you want to. Just tell us what's staying and what's going; we handle the rest.</p>
                <p><strong>Junk Hauling:</strong> Dump runs, transfer station fees, donation drop-offs at Goodwill or Habitat ReStore, responsible disposal of anything that can't be donated. All included in the flat rate. You don't see a separate invoice for "hauling."</p>
                <p><strong>Deep Cleaning:</strong> Floors swept and mopped, walls wiped down, cobwebs cleared from corners and rafters. Many clients use our cleanup to pass their final walkthrough inspection with zero issues—no deductions, no arguments.</p>
                <p><strong>Before/After Documentation:</strong> We photograph everything. You get proof of the condition for landlords, buyers, or your own records. This has saved more than a few clients from unfair deposit disputes.</p>
                <p><strong>Move-In Ready Setup:</strong> If you're the one moving in, we can arrange the space so it's ready to receive your belongings—clean floor, clear access paths, maybe some basic organization if you're keeping existing shelving. You pull up with your truck and the space is waiting.</p>
            </section>
            
            <section>
                <h2>What People Try Instead (And Why It Doesn't Work)</h2>
                <p>We've talked to hundreds of people who tried to handle the garage themselves during a move. The stories are remarkably consistent:</p>
                <p><em>"I spent my entire last weekend dealing with the garage instead of saying goodbye to neighbors and finishing packing the house. Still didn't get it all done. Ended up throwing things in the moving truck just to get out on time."</em></p>
                <p><em>"I made four trips to the dump. Each one took two hours round trip plus waiting in line. By the end I was just throwing things in my car that probably could've been donated because I ran out of energy to care."</em></p>
                <p><em>"I asked friends to help and then felt incredibly guilty asking them to haul literal garbage on their Saturday when they thought they were helping with the move."</em></p>
                <p><em>"I left some stuff behind figuring the new owners would deal with it or it would just get trashed. Got an angry call from my landlord threatening to charge me $800 for removal plus cleaning. Would've been cheaper to hire you."</em></p>
                <p>Moving is already one of life's most stressful events. The garage doesn't need to make it worse—especially when the solution costs less than what you're paying the movers for a couple hours of labor.</p>

We come in, assess everything, and remove it all. If we find anything that looks potentially valuable or personal (documents, photos, jewelry), we'll set it aside and contact you before disposing. But for most move-in cleanouts, it's straightforward junk removal of things the previous owner couldn't be bothered to take.</p></div>
                <div class="faq-item"><h3>Can you coordinate with my movers or real estate agent?</h3><p>Yes—we do it all the time. We're happy to schedule around your moving company's arrival, coordinate key handoffs with your landlord or property manager, or work directly with real estate agents during escrow. Moving involves a lot of people and tight timing. We fit into whatever flow works for you without adding complexity.</p></div>
                <div class="faq-item"><h3>What about items I want to take with me but haven't packed yet?</h3><p>Just point them out or mark them beforehand—even tape and a marker works. We can work around boxes and items that are coming with you. Or if you'd prefer, we can help sort: putting "keep" items in one zone and clearing absolutely everything else. Whatever makes your move easier.</p></div>
                <div class="faq-item"><h3>Do you handle storage unit cleanouts for moves too?</h3><p>Yes. Same process—you give us access, we remove everything (or everything except what you flag to keep), and coordinate with the storage facility on key return and final billing. This is especially useful for people who got a temporary unit during their move and now need it emptied quickly to stop the monthly charges.</p></div>
