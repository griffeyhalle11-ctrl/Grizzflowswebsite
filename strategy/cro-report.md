## 2. Sales Scripts

### 📞 PHONE SCRIPT: Inbound Leads

**Goal:** Be helpful, not salesy. Get the appointment.

```
[Phone rings]

YOU: "Hey, this is [Name] with GrizzFlow's Garage!"

[Let them explain their situation - LISTEN]

THEM: [Describes their garage nightmare]

YOU: "Got it! Yeah, we see that all the time - garages just become the dumping 
ground for everything, right? [Laugh]

So let me ask a couple quick questions so I can give you an accurate estimate:

1. Roughly how big is your garage - one car, two car, three car?
2. On a scale of 1-10, how full is it right now?
3. Is most of it stuff you want gone, or stuff that needs to be organized?
4. Any super heavy items - like a hot tub, safe, or exercise equipment?

[Write down answers]

YOU: "Perfect. Based on what you're describing, you're probably looking at 
somewhere between $[range] - but I'd love to swing by and give you an 
exact quote. Takes about 15 minutes, totally free, no pressure.

What works better for you - [tomorrow] or [day after]? Morning or afternoon?"

[Book the estimate appointment]

YOU: "Great, I've got you down for [day/time]. I'll text you a confirmation 
right now with my number. If anything comes up, just shoot me a text. 
Looking forward to seeing the space!"
```

**Key Principles:**
- Let THEM talk 70% of the time
- Use their words back to them ("So you mentioned you can't even park in there...")
- Give a range, not a firm price, over the phone
- Always book the in-person estimate

```

**If still no response - DROP IT. Move on. Add to quarterly re-engagement list.**

---

### Objection Handling

#### "That's more than I expected" / "Too expensive"

```
"I totally get it - garage projects can definitely be an investment. Let me ask: 
is it the total that's the issue, or would it help to break this into phases? 

We could start with just the cleanout and junk removal for $[smaller amount], 
and then tackle the organization later when it makes sense for your budget."
```

**Alternative:**
```
"I hear you. Out of curiosity, what were you expecting it to be? 

[If reasonable gap] Let me see what I can do. If we skip [X], I could get it 
down to $[Y]. Would that work?"

[If wildly off] I appreciate the honesty. Unfortunately at that price point 
I'd be losing money. But tell you what - if you want to do some of the prep 
work yourself, like boxing up items you're keeping, I could take off $[X]."
```

#### "I need to think about it"

```
"Totally understand - it's a big decision! Is there anything specific you're 
trying to figure out? Sometimes talking it through helps.

[PAUSE - let them answer]

[If they share concern, address it]

[If they don't] No worries at all. I'll follow up in a couple days. If you 
have any questions in the meantime, just text me."
```

#### "I want to get other quotes"

```
"Makes total sense - you should definitely feel good about who you hire. 

One thing to keep in mind: make sure you're comparing apples to apples. Some 
guys quote low and then hit you with dump fees and 'extra charges' day-of. 
My quote is all-inclusive - no surprises.

Happy to answer any questions when you've got your other quotes!"
```

#### "I need to check with my spouse"

```
"Of course! Totally get it. Would it help if I stuck around for 5 minutes so 
you could give them a quick call while I'm here? That way I can answer any 
questions directly.

[If no] No problem. When do you think you'll have a chance to chat with them? 
I'll follow up [that day/tomorrow]."
```

---

## 4. Referral Program

### Program Design

**Offer: $50 Dual Incentive**
- Referrer gets: $50 credit toward next service OR $50 cash (their choice)
- New customer gets: $50 off their first job

**Why this works:**
- Cash option makes it real (not everyone needs another service)
- Dual-sided incentive gives referrer a reason to push
- $50 is meaningful but doesn't destroy margins on a $300-600 job

---

### How to Ask for Referrals (Without Being Awkward)

**Best timing:** Right after completing a successful job, during the "wow" moment

**The Natural Ask:**
```
[While walking through completed garage]

YOU: "So what do you think? Pretty different from this morning, right?"

THEM: "This is amazing, I can't believe it..."

YOU: "That's awesome, so glad you're happy with it! Hey, quick question - 
do you know anyone else dealing with a garage like yours was? Friends, 
neighbors, family?

We're growing mostly through word of mouth, and I've got a referral thing 
where you both get $50 off. No pressure at all, but if anyone comes to 
mind, just send them my way."

[Hand them 2 referral cards]

"Here's a couple cards with my info. The code on the back tracks it back to you."
```

**Follow-Up Ask (1 week after job, via text):**
```
Hey [Name]! Hope you're loving your new garage. 🔧

Quick favor - if you know anyone dealing with a garage disaster, I'd 
really appreciate a referral. You'd both get $50 off. No pressure, just 
thought I'd mention it!
```

| **Quarterly maintenance plan** | $99/quarter | 10-15% | Recurring revenue! |

---

### How to Present Upsells Naturally

**The key: Don't "sell" - OBSERVE and SUGGEST**

**During the estimate walk-through:**

```
[Looking at bare walls]
"You know, one thing I notice is you've got a ton of vertical space going to 
waste. If you wanted, we could throw up some heavy-duty shelving on this 
wall - gets everything off the floor and suddenly you've got way more room. 
Usually runs about $[X] installed. Just something to think about."

[Looking at stained floor]
"The floor's seen some action, huh? [laugh] After we clean it, it'll look 
better, but if you ever want to take it to the next level, epoxy coating 
is a game-changer. Not saying you need it - just planting the seed."

[Seeing tools scattered everywhere]
"Are you a tools guy? I've got a lot of customers who love having a pegboard 
setup - all your tools visible and organized. I could add that in for around 
$[X] if that's interesting to you."
```

**In the quote (as line items):**

```
CORE SERVICE: Garage Cleanout & Organization     $[X]

OPTIONAL ADD-ONS (just let me know!):
• Wall shelving (2 sections)                     +$350
• Pegboard tool organizer                        +$200
• Floor pressure wash                            +$100
```

**After the job (upsell for next time):**

```
"Alright, looks great in here! One thing - now that you can actually see 
your floor, have you thought about epoxy coating? It's like night and day, 
and way easier to keep clean. If you're ever interested, I can get you a 
quote. No rush though - just thought I'd mention it!"
```

---

### Upsell Script: The Bundle Close

When presenting the initial quote, offer a "package deal":

```
"So here's what I'm thinking. The basic cleanout and organization is $[X]. 
But honestly, if you want to really maximize this space, here's what I'd do:

The cleanout, plus two sections of shelving, plus a pegboard for your tools. 
That's $[X + Y + Z] = $[Total] à la carte.

BUT - if you do it all at once, I'll knock $75 off since I'm already here 
with all my stuff. So $[Total - 75].

Totally up to you - the basic service alone will be a huge improvement. 
But if you want the full transformation, that's the way to go."
```
