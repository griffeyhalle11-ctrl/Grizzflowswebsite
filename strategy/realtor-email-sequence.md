# GrizzFlow's Garage -- Realtor Cold Outreach Email Sequence (v2)

## Target: South Bay Luxury Real Estate Agents
## Sender: GrizzFlow (owner, GrizzFlow's Garage)
## Tone: Local business owner. Short. Direct. No stats-dumping. Pain-point first.
## Language: "Pre-listing garage prep" or "garage staging" -- NOT "garage cleanup"

---

## PARTNERSHIP STRUCTURE OPTIONS

Present these AFTER trust is established (not in the cold emails). Lead with the free trial to get in the door.

### Option A: Referral Fee (Simplest)
- Agent refers a client to GrizzFlow's Garage
- Agent receives **$50-$75 per completed job** (or 10% of job price)
- No paperwork burden -- GrizzFlow tracks and pays monthly via Venmo/check
- Best for: agents who want passive income with zero effort

### Option B: Priority Scheduling (Most Attractive for Luxury Agents)
- Agents get **dedicated priority scheduling** -- their clients jump the queue
- Guaranteed same-week service for any agent referral
- Direct text line to GrizzFlow (not the general inbox)
- Best for: agents who care more about reliability than referral fees

### Option C: White-Label / "Your Team" Positioning
- GrizzFlow operates as part of the agent's pre-listing team
- Agent can present it as a **complimentary service they provide to sellers** (agent covers the cost as a listing expense, or splits it)
- Co-branded before/after report with agent's logo for listing materials
- Agent says "I have a team that handles the garage prep" -- positions them as full-service
- Best for: luxury agents who want to differentiate their listing package

### Option D: Free First Job (Trial Offer -- Lead With This)
- GrizzFlow does **one free garage prep ($350 value)** on an agent's active listing
- No strings attached -- agent sees the quality firsthand
- If impressed, we discuss ongoing partnership
- Best for: initial outreach to break through skepticism

**Recommended approach**: Lead with Option D in every first email. Introduce Options B and C only in follow-up conversations once the agent has seen the work. Option A is the fallback for agents who want to keep it transactional.

## EMAIL 1: INITIAL COLD OUTREACH

### Subject Line Variations (A/B Test)
- A: `The garage at [specific street name] -- quick thought`
- B: `Quick question about pre-listing prep`
- C: `The one room your sellers keep putting off`

**Personalization note**: Subject line A requires looking up a specific active listing from the agent. Use a real street name, not a placeholder. If you cannot find one, use B or C.

### Email Body

> [Agent first name],
>
> I do pre-listing garage prep in the South Bay -- cleanout, organization, junk haul-away. Flat rate, one day, done.
>
> You have probably had the seller who says "I will get to the garage this weekend" and three weeks later the photographer is coming and it still looks like a storage unit. I handle that so you do not have to nag.
>
> I would like to do a **free garage prep on one of your active listings** -- no strings. If you like the work, we talk. If not, your seller still gets a clean garage.
>
> Text me if interested -- **509-860-9850**.
>
> -- GrizzFlow
> grizzflowsgarage.com | Hermosa Beach

### Why This Works
- 82 words. Readable on a phone in 15 seconds.
- Opens with what we do in one line -- no preamble.
- "The seller who says I will get to it this weekend" -- every agent has lived this exact moment. It is the universal pain point.
- No stats, no ROI math, no market data recitation. The agent knows their market.
- Free offer with zero commitment. Not "let's schedule a call." Just "text me."
- "Pre-listing garage prep" -- not "garage cleanup." Language the agent can use with their $4M sellers.
- Ends with text (not email, not phone call) -- how busy agents actually communicate.

---

## EMAIL 2: FOLLOW-UP #1 (3-4 Days Later)

### Subject Line Variations
- A: `Re: Pre-listing garage prep`
- B: `The last room on the showing tour`
- C: `Before the photographer comes`

### Email Body

> [Agent first name],
>
> Following up. The garage is usually the last room buyers walk through on a showing -- and the last impression before they get back in the car. It should not be the worst room in the house.
>
> I handle the full job: cleanout, organization, junk haul-away. Flat rate, same-week scheduling. I coordinate around your showing calendar so nothing gets disrupted.
>
> The free garage prep offer still stands for any active listing. Just text me -- **509-860-9850**.
>
> -- GrizzFlow

### Why This Works
- 73 words. Even shorter than Email 1.
- Different angle: the showing walkthrough / last impression. No jargon like "recency bias."
- Adds new information: same-week scheduling, coordinates with showing calendar.
- Does not repeat the "nagging seller" pain point from Email 1 -- fresh angle.
- Still no stats. Still no market data.

---

## EMAIL 3: FOLLOW-UP #2 (7 Days After Email 2)

### Subject Line Variations
- A: `Before/after from a garage in Hermosa this week`
- B: `6 hours, one garage, photo-ready`
- C: `What a couple South Bay agents are doing`

### Email Body

> [Agent first name],
>
> Prepped a 3-car garage in Hermosa last week -- seller had been "meaning to get to it" for three months. Took us 6 hours. Listing photos went up two days later.
>
> A couple of South Bay agents have started texting me the address when they get a new listing and I just handle the garage before the photographer shows up. No back-and-forth with the seller, no nagging.
>
> Happy to send you the before/after photos, or do one free on your next listing. Offer still stands.
>
> **509-860-9850**
>
> -- GrizzFlow

### Why This Works
- 85 words. Social proof without being heavy-handed.
- Specific story: 3-car garage, Hermosa, 6 hours, photos two days later. Concrete and believable.
- "A couple of South Bay agents" -- not "your competitors" (too aggressive). Just normalizes the behavior.
- "Text me the address and I handle it" -- paints the picture of how frictionless the partnership is.
- Keeps free offer alive one more time.

---

## EMAIL 4: BREAKUP EMAIL (14 Days After Email 3)

### Subject Line Variations
- A: `Last note from me, [Agent first name]`
- B: `Closing the loop`
- C: `Not the right time?`

### Email Body

> [Agent first name],
>
> Do not want to be another vendor in your inbox. This is my last note.
>
> If you ever have a listing where the garage needs work before photos, I am one text away. Flat rate, same week, junk included.
>
> **509-860-9850** | grizzflowsgarage.com
>
> -- GrizzFlow

### Why This Works
- 43 words. The shortest email possible.
- Respectful. No guilt. No "last chance" urgency.
- Plants the seed: "if you ever have a listing where the garage needs work" -- this will stick.
- Phone number and website. That is it.

## SUBJECT LINE MASTER LIST

| Email | Option A | Option B | Option C |
|-------|----------|----------|----------|
| #1 | The garage at [street name] -- quick thought | Quick question about pre-listing prep | The one room your sellers keep putting off |
| #2 | Re: Pre-listing garage prep | The last room on the showing tour | Before the photographer comes |
| #3 | Before/after from a garage in Hermosa this week | 6 hours, one garage, photo-ready | What a couple South Bay agents are doing |
| #4 | Last note from me, [Name] | Closing the loop | Not the right time? |

### Subject Line Rules
- **Use a real street name** from the agent's active listing whenever possible (Subject 1A). Look it up before sending. This is the highest-open-rate move.
- **Never use**: "partnership," "opportunity," "boost," "exclusive," "limited time," "ROI"
- **Keep under 45 characters** for full mobile display
- **"Re:" on Email 2** only if Subject 1B was used (keeps the thread honest)

## VALUE PROPOSITION ONE-PAGER

Send this ONLY when an agent responds and asks for more info. Do NOT attach to cold emails.

### Header
**Pre-Listing Garage Prep for South Bay Agents**
*GrizzFlow's Garage -- Hermosa Beach*

### The Problem
- Sellers stage the kitchen, the living room, the bathrooms -- and skip the garage
- The garage is the one space where three months of "I will get to it this weekend" lives
- A cluttered garage is the last impression buyers take with them after a showing

### What We Do
- Full garage prep: cleanout, organization, junk haul-away
- One day, flat rate, no surprises
- Same-week scheduling -- we work around your showing calendar
- We coordinate directly with your photographer if needed

### Pricing
| Tier | Price | Best For |
|------|-------|----------|
| Light Prep | $350 | 1-car garage, light clutter |
| Standard Prep | $525 | 2-car garage or heavy 1-car |
| Deep Prep | $695 | Major cleanouts, 3-car garages |
| Total Transformation | $950 | Estate-sized, extreme situations |

*Junk haul-away included in every tier. No hidden fees.*

### How It Works
1. **Text GrizzFlow**: 509-860-9850
2. **We schedule within the week**

## SENDING STRATEGY

### Stagger Outreach -- Critical
South Bay luxury agents talk to each other. Do NOT email multiple top Manhattan Beach agents on the same day. Space them out:
- **Week 1**: 2-3 agents max, spread across different cities (one MB, one Hermosa, one PV)
- **Week 2**: Next batch of 2-3
- **Week 3**: Next batch
- If one agent responds, pause outreach to agents in their immediate circle until you have delivered a great result

### Tier 1 Agents -- Hand-Personalize Every Email
These agents warrant looking up a specific active listing and using the street name in the subject line:

- **Bryn Stroyke (Stroyke Properties / Bayside)**: Manhattan Beach and Strand specialist. Do not reference his $2B in sales -- he knows. Find one of his active listings and reference the address. Frame around making his pre-listing process even smoother.
- **Jen Caskey Group**: Known for premier client experience. The white-label angle (Option C) fits their brand -- "I have a team that handles garage prep" aligns with their full-service positioning.
- **Lauren Forbes (Compass)**: Top producer. Reference a specific listing. Keep it short -- she is busy and does not need to be educated.
- **Jagger Kroener**: Newer, ambitious. The "agents who text me the address and I handle it" angle positions him as having a sophisticated vendor network.

### Tier 2 Agents
- **Molly Hobin Williams (The Hobin Company)**: Deep Manhattan Beach roots. Genuine local-to-local angle.
- **Dave Fratello (Edge Real Estate)**: Boutique, tech-forward. His listing photos are part of his brand -- a garage that does not match the rest of the house hurts that.
- **Patricia Blakemore (HOMES 90266)**: Luxury specialist, 90266 zip code. Reference a Hermosa or Manhattan listing specifically.
- **Bayside partners**: Geographic overlap makes this a natural fit.

### Palos Verdes Specialists
- **Suzanne Dyer, Keith Kyle**: Reference PV-specific realities -- gated communities, estate-sized 3-4 car garages, oversized spaces. Use the PV pricing tier ($399-$1,100+) in the one-pager if they request it.

### Timing
- **Best send times**: Tuesday-Thursday, 7:00-8:00 AM or 6:00-7:00 PM
- **Avoid**: Monday morning, Friday afternoon, weekends
- **Season**: February-March is ideal -- agents are prepping for spring listing season

### After They Reply
- Respond within 1 hour. Speed matters.
- Do NOT send the one-pager immediately. First, ask: "Which listing should I look at?" -- this advances the conversation.
- After the free job is complete, follow up within 24 hours with before/after photos and a simple ask: "Want me to handle the garage on your next one?"
- Stop the email sequence immediately if they reply (positive or negative).

## WHAT NOT TO DO (Lessons from Skeptic Review)

These were flagged as instant-delete triggers by a luxury realtor who reviewed the drafts:

1. **Do not use ROI math** ("1% of $3.3M = $33K"). Agents will not attribute 1% of a home's value to a garage. It feels like a stretch and damages credibility.
2. **Do not dump NAR statistics** into emails. "91% of agents recommend decluttering" tells an agent nothing they do not already know. It is padding.
3. **Do not recite market prices** back to agents. They know Manhattan Beach median is $3.3M. Quoting it signals you are reading from a script.
4. **Do not cite agent rankings or sales volume**. "I saw you were #1 in Manhattan Beach" feels like manipulation, not flattery.
5. **Do not say "garage cleanup."** Say "pre-listing garage prep" or "garage staging." The agent needs language they can use with a $4M seller.
6. **Do not use the word "partnership"** in subject lines or the first email. It screams vendor pitch.
7. **Do not ask for a call or meeting** in the first email. Offer one free job. That is it.
8. **Do not email competing agents on the same day.** They talk. Space it out.
9. **Do not go over 100 words** in any email. These people are reading on phones between showings.
10. **Do not use "recency bias" or other psychology jargon.** Just describe it plainly: "the last room buyers walk through."

## STATS -- USE SPARINGLY AND ONLY IN CONVERSATION

These statistics are available for in-person meetings or phone calls if an agent asks "why should I care about the garage?" Do NOT put them in cold emails.

| Stat | Source | When to Use |
|------|--------|-------------|
| 91% of agents recommend decluttering | NAR 2025 Staging Report | Only if agent asks for data |
| Staged homes spend 90% less time on market | NAR 2025 | Phone/in-person conversation |
| 29% of agents saw 1-10% price increase | NAR 2025 | Phone/in-person conversation |
| Garage door replacement ROI: 103% | Remodeling Magazine 2023 | In-person meeting |
| 83% of buyer agents say staging helps | NAR 2025 | In-person meeting |
| Manhattan Beach median: $3.325M | 2025 market data | NEVER in emails (they know) |
| Hermosa Beach average: $4.28M | 2025 market data | NEVER in emails (they know) |
